# AGENTS.md

## Purpose
This document is the living handoff for engineers/agents working in this repository.
Update it whenever architecture, routes, data models, auth behavior, deployment, or developer commands change.

## Product Snapshot
Issue Prompt Tracker is a responsive web app + API for capturing project-specific issues/features with screenshots and converting them into AI-ready prompt bundles (`yaml + images`).

## Current Architecture
- Frontend: `apps/web` (React + Vite)
- Backend: `apps/api` (Fastify + Prisma)
- Shared package: `packages/shared` (prompt format/build helpers)
- Database: Postgres (Docker compose)
- Storage: filesystem uploads (configured via `UPLOAD_DIR`)

## Frontend Structure (Web)
- Auth screen: login/register
- Authenticated shell with routed pages:
  - `/issues`: issue/feature CRUD, image attachments, edit/delete
  - `/projects`: project CRUD + active project selection
  - `/categories`: global category CRUD
  - `/prompts`: filter items, copy prompt, download item/project prompt bundles
  - `/prompt-templates`: per-project template editor for `issue` / `feature` / `other` prompt variants
- Mobile-first navigation:
  - desktop sidebar nav
  - bottom tab nav on small screens
- PWA-enabled build (manifest + service worker via `vite-plugin-pwa`)
- Branding assets served from `apps/web/public/branding`

## Backend Auth + Access Control
- JWT auth endpoints:
  - `POST /api/auth/register`
  - `POST /api/auth/login`
  - `GET /api/auth/me`
- Roles:
  - `USER`: sees/manages own projects/items
  - `ADMIN`: sees/manages all projects/items
- Admin bootstrap on API startup using env:
  - `ADMIN_EMAIL`
  - `ADMIN_PASSWORD`
  - `ADMIN_NAME`
- JWT env:
  - `JWT_SECRET`
  - `JWT_EXPIRES_IN`

## Data Model Notes
- `User` model added with `role`
- `Project.ownerId` and `Item.ownerId` enforce per-user scope
- `PromptTemplate` stores per-project template text keyed by `CategoryKind` (`issue` / `feature` / `other`)
- Existing records are backfilled to admin owner on startup if owner is null

## Dev Commands
- Install: `npm install`
- Setup dev environment: `npm run setup:dev`
- Start app: `npm run dev`
- Run tests: `npm run test`
- Build all: `npm run build`
- Stop local DB: `npm run stop:devdb`

## Local Environment Notes
- Local Postgres host port: `55432`
- `.env` must include auth vars + DB URL

## Change Log
### 2026-02-23
- Implemented auth layer (JWT, register/login/me) and role-based access (`ADMIN`/`USER`).
- Added user ownership to projects/items and migration `20260223211000_add_auth`.
- Added admin bootstrap and legacy ownership backfill on API startup.
- Fixed frontend JSON parse failure by setting `Content-Type: application/json` only for JSON-body requests.
- Rebuilt frontend UX into responsive routed pages (`/projects`, `/categories`, `/issues`, `/prompts`) with dedicated CRUD experiences and mobile navigation.
- Added Vite dev proxy for `/api` and `/uploads` to API server.
- Updated local DB host mapping to port `55432` to avoid conflicts.
- Verification performed:
  - `npm run test`
  - `npm run build`
- Fixed issue form UX regression on `/issues/:itemId/edit`:
  - existing saved screenshots now render in the Details tab (not just newly queued images)
  - added preview/remove controls for saved screenshots directly from the edit/manage form
- Migration/env impact: none.
- Verification performed:
  - `npm run build -w apps/web`
- Added reusable screenshot copy UI component and wired it into both prompt workflows:
  - issue form Prompt tab now shows per-screenshot copy buttons
  - `/prompts` page now shows per-screenshot copy buttons for the selected item (same component reused)
  - screenshot list is rendered before prompt textarea on `/prompts` for immediate visibility
- Migration/env impact: none.
- Verification performed:
  - `npm run build -w apps/web`
  - `npm run test`
- 2026-02-24
- 2026-02-24
- Fixed residual responsiveness issues on `/agentic-coding`:
  - split docs layout into dedicated public vs embedded shells (`docs-page-public` / `docs-page-embedded`) to prevent viewport-width overflow inside authenticated route host
  - changed docs container sizing to parent-relative width (`min(1200px, 100%)`) instead of viewport-relative width

- Migration/env impact: none.
- Verification performed:
  - `npm run build -w apps/web`
- Expanded item management on `/issues` (items list view) with full filtering controls:
  - filters for `search`, `type`, `status`, `priority`, `category`, and `tag`
  - clear-filters action to reset list filters in one click
- Added quick item status action buttons on each list card (`open`, `in progress`, `resolved`, `archived`).

  - updated `skills/aam-issue-tracker-agent/agents/openai.yaml` default prompt to require pre-action context and image review
  - added agent endpoint `GET /api/agent/v1/issues/:id/work-context` returning issue detail + prompt + explicit pre-action checklist
  - updated agent docs:
    - `apps/api/docs/agent-api-reference.md`
    - `apps/api/docs/agentic-coding.md`
    - `apps/api/docs/agent-polling-playbook.md`
  - repackaged `apps/web/public/skills/aam-issue-tracker-agent.zip`
- Migration/env impact: none.

- Implemented issue `cmm0j38un000hqzm804i2vu56` ("Install and run skills instructions") on the public/authenticated `/agentic-coding` page:
  - replaced static install snippet with copyable command blocks
  - added tabbed CLI views with copy actions for `Codex`, `Claude Code`, `Gemini CLI`, and `GitHub Copilot`
  - switched env setup guidance to home-directory scoped files (`$HOME/.env.skills/...`) so commands work across multiple repositories/directories
  - auto-fills `AAM_API_BASE_URL` from the current site origin and auto-fills `AAM_PROJECT_ID` from the active signed-in project (while keeping `AAM_API_KEY` as user-provided)
  - wired authenticated docs route to pass the active project into `AgentDocsPage`
- Updated README agent skill section to match the new cross-repo env-file pattern and list supported CLIs.
- Migration/env impact:
  - no DB migration
  - no new environment variables
- Verification performed:
  - `npm run build -w apps/web`

- Fixed agent API error handling so malformed JSON no longer appears as an internal server failure:
  - updated `app.setErrorHandler` in `apps/api/src/server.ts` to preserve explicit client-status errors (`4xx`) emitted by Fastify
  - malformed JSON on `POST /api/agent/v1/issues/:id/resolve` now returns `400` with parser message instead of `500 Unexpected server error`
  - valid resolve calls still succeed and return issue + resolution payload
- Migration/env impact: none.
- Verification performed:
  - `npm run build -w apps/api`
  - malformed JSON request to `/api/agent/v1/issues/:id/resolve` returns `400`
  - valid JSON request to `/api/agent/v1/issues/:id/resolve` returns `200`

- Fixed mobile screenshot picker behavior on issue form dropzone:
  - removed camera-forced behavior from primary screenshot picker so `Choose Screenshots` opens gallery/files on mobile
  - added dedicated `Use Camera` action with a separate capture-enabled input for direct camera capture when desired
  - updated dropzone helper copy to clarify gallery vs camera actions
- Migration/env impact: none.
- Verification performed:
  - `npm run build -w apps/web`
